# MDA Projects

In this project, 430 Obama speeches from 2004 to 2018 are analyzed to find out how his speeches change based on circumstances. 

## LDA model and Topic analysis: In this notebook, LDA model is applied to classify speeches into five different topics, with keywords and representative texts.

## Sentiment Analysis: Textblob is used to get the polarity and subjectivity for each of Obama speeches. Polarities between different topics are compared to see which topics tend to be more positive. 

## Correlation with outside sources: Data such as GDP and military spending from 2004 to 2018 has been drawn, to compare their trend and the trend of a specific topic appearance.
